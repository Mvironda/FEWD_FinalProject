				<h2>Numerical Reasoning Tests</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>These tests offer data and then test your ability to determine the methodology and perform the 	calculations that are required to obtain the answer to the question given</li>
					<li>Calculations involving currency conversions, ratios, percentage increases/decreases and interpretation from a range of charts are particularly common</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>About the numerical reasoning practise session</h3>
				<p>
				You are about to start a timed practice numerical reasoning test session.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this session, you will be using your problem solving and mathematical skills. You will be presented with some data and your task will be to determine the process needed to obtain the answer and perform the necessary calculations.
				</p>
				<ul>So that you know:
					<li>You have 20 minutes to answer 20 questions so you will need to do the session in one sitting</li>
					<li>You should work alone</li>
					<li>After each question there are five response options</li>
					<li>There is one, and only one, correct answer to each question</li>
					<li>You should select the response choice you think comes next in the sequence</li>
					<li>All of the information you need to answer these questions is provided in the data</li>
					<li>Once you have answered a question and clicked the next button you will not be able to go back to the question or change your answer</li>
					<li>Please do not use the “back” button on your browser – doing so may invalidate your practise session</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>Our advice is to:
					<li>Take the test in a quiet area</li>
					<li>Plug your laptop in to ensure the battery does not run out</li>
					<li>Try to work quickly but accurately</li>
					<li>Not to spend too long on any one question</li>
					<li>Mark your best choice and go on to the next question, even if you are not sure of an answer</li>
					<li>That being said, do not just guess without fully considering the options available</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Bottom line...</h3>
				<p>
					This training programme gives you the opportunity to become familiar with the overall experience of taking an employer’s online tests so try your best and good luck!
				</p>
				<h3>Ready to go? Let’s try an example question first</h3>
				<p>
					The following table shows information on revenue for a hotel across three years. Study the information and answer the question which follows.
